# ðŸ”¢ Handwritten Digits Classification with SVM

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** from `scikit-learn`. The model is trained on the classic **Digits Dataset**, which contains 8x8 grayscale images of handwritten numbers.  

It includes a full pipeline: from **data loading**, **preprocessing**, and **model training** to **evaluation** and **visualizing predictions** â€” all clearly structured and well-commented for learning and reuse.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Loads the built-in `sklearn.datasets.load_digits` dataset (no download required)
- âœ… Flattens 8x8 image matrices into 1D feature vectors
- âœ… Splits data into training and testing sets (70/30)
- âœ… Trains a **Support Vector Machine (SVC)** classifier with adjustable `gamma`
- âœ… Evaluates the model using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix (with labels)
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
- âœ… Displays prediction and actual label for a sample digit with its image

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The [Digits Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html) contains:

- **1797 images** of handwritten digits (0â€“9)
- Each image is **8Ã—8 pixels** (grayscale)
- Total of **64 features per sample**
- Labels are integers from **0 to 9**
